/*
    This class will play a game of Hangman with the user.
    The user is asked to guess the word that the game has chosen.
    The user has to guess the word one letter at a time.
    The user has a fixed number of guesses.
    After each guess the game shows the user the result of the guess, which is one of three things
        -- the guessed letter is not in the word, and is added to the wrong guesses, which are shown to the user at every go
        -- the guessed letter is in the word. so the word is updated and shown to the user
        -- the letter has already been guessed, so the user is reminded that they have already tried that letter
    If the word is complete before or when the user's guesses have all been made, then the game tells the user they have won
    If the word is not complete when the user's guesses have all been made, then the game tells the user they have lost.
